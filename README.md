# Held Item Info

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod that shows information (like enchantments) about the held item under its name. Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api). 

The following can be displayed when holding an item:
- Enchantments 
- Potion effects
- Container contents (mainly Shulker Boxes, but other block entity containers should work)
- Firework attributes (flight duration, shape, color)
- Commands inside of command blocks
- Number of bees inside Bee Nests/Beehives
- Lore
- `Unbreakable` tag
- Sign text
- Title of Music Discs
- Author and generation of Written Books
- Banner Pattern (only for the `Banner Pattern` items, not for actual banners)
- Type of tropical fish inside a bucket

Each of these can be toggled individually in-game if both [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files) and a recent version of [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) are installed.
