# Held Item Info

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod that shows information (like enchantments) about the held item under its name.

The following can be displayed when holding an item:
- Enchantments
- Potion effects
- Container contents (mainly Shulker Boxes, but other block entity containers should work)
- Firework attributes (flight duration, shape, color)
- Commands inside of command blocks
- Number of bees inside Bee Nests/Beehives
- Sign text
- Actual names of music discs
- Authors of written books
- `Unbreakable` tag
- Banner pattern type (only for `Banner Pattern` items, not for actual banners)
- Type of tropical fish inside a bucket
