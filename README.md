# Held Item Info

A mod that shows information (like enchantments!) about the held item under its name.

* Stuff only shows up on the HUD when changing item in main hand (just like in Bedrock Edition)

* Modded enchantments and potion effects should work properly



## Full list of things that can be shown when holding stuff

* Enchantments
* Potion effects
* Container contents (mainly Shulker Boxes, but other block entity containers should work)
* Firework attributes (flight duration, shape, color)
* Commands inside of command blocks
* Number of bees inside of bee nests/beehives
* Sign text
* Actual names of music discs
* Authors of written books
* `Unbreakable` tag
* Banner pattern type (only for `Banner Pattern` items, not for actual banners)
* Type of tropical fish inside of a bucket
