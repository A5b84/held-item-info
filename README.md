# Held Item Info

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) / [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) mod that shows information (like enchantments) about the held item under its name.

The following can be displayed when holding an item:
- Enchantments
- Potion effects
- Container contents (e.g. Shulker Boxes and Bundles)
- Commands inside of command blocks
- Firework attributes (flight duration, shape, color)
- Number of bees inside Bee Nests/Beehives
- Entity spawned by Spawners
- Projectiles in a crossbow
- Lore
- `Unbreakable` tag
- Sign text
- Title of Music Discs and Disc Fragments
- Painting information (title, author, dimensions)
- Instrument of Goat Horns
- Author and generation of Written Books
- Filled map identifier
- Banner Pattern (both for banner pattern items and actual banners or shields)
- Type of tropical fish inside a bucket

Each of these can be toggled individually in-game if both Mod Menu ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)) and a recent version of Cloth Config ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)) are installed.
